# Ki email signature generator

We've been reading our emails and we've noticed that the lovely people that work at Ki all have slightly different email signatures.

Sometimes the name is in bold. Sometimes titles are after the name - sometimes underneath. Sometimes phone numbers are displayed differently.

Simply put, they aren't very standardised, and that just _won't do_.

At a very high level, what we'd like you to do is create an application that allows us to create a standardised (but still a little customise-able) signature template for everyone at Ki to use.

**Please write tests for all tasks.**
