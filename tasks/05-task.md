# Telephone numbers and contact details

We think that it makes sense for the user to be able to add their telephone numbers to their email signature.

We need to be able to add multiple numbers:
    - Work
    - Mobile
    - Teams

Adding contact details is optional - and some users might not want to, and other users might put all three.

Please validate that the values the user is putting in is a valid telephone number, and ensure you show the appropriate keyboard on mobile.
