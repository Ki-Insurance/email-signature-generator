# Adding their names

We think that it makes sense for the user to be able to add their name to their email signature.

The user should be able to put their name into the app, and see it rendered on screen.

_Hint:_ Please use [user-event](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-user-event) for typing into the form in the tests.
