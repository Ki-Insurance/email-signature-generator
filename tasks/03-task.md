# Users should be able to add their pronouns and titles to their email signature

We think that it makes sense for the user to be able to add their pronouns (please just use a free text), and their titles to their email signature.

```gherkin
GIVEN I am an employee at KI
WHEN I put my pronouns into the application
THEN I should see my pronouns in my email signature
```

```gherkin
GIVEN I am an employee at KI
WHEN I put my titles into the application
THEN I should see my titles in my email signature
```
