# Jazz up the UI and impress us!

Have free reign to make it look nice! 

Really do whatever you feel like:
- Nice shadows?
- Light mode/dark mode?
- Comic-sans mode?
- Mobile support?
- Offline support?
- Actually make the email signature work in an email client? (Actually quite annoying to do - so only if you're willing to be frustrated by inconsistent email standards)
