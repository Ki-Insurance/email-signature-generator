Heya there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to [Ki](https://www.ki-insurance.com)'s takehome frontend developer showcase!

> I just wanted to say thank you for interviewing with us! The job hunting process can be a really stressful and anxious time, but I promise you, we don't bite! 
>
> If there's anything you need or any accommodations we can make so you feel at ease _please_ let us know and we'll do out best to sort it!

This is way less of a test with right and wrong answers and more of us looking at:
- "How do you write code?"
- "How do you test?"
- "Do you use semicolons or are you living dangerously?" ðŸ™„

If you're struggling to work out what the "right answer" looks like please don't! This codebase is really just going to be a conversation starter for our next discussion, so please don't worry about perfect.

What we are looking for is a React application that meets the criteria set out in the (tasks)[./tasks] folder. There's a quite a few different tasks in there - so please, feel no obligation to do all of them - keep going until you get bored or stuck and just let us know where you get upto.

You can put as much or as little into this as you'd like - so feel free to go a bit wild if you want.

### Getting setup
All we've set up a server [vite](https://vitejs.dev), hooked up [jest](https://jestjs.io) and [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) - and that's about it.

#### Prerequisites
- A code editor
- A modernish version of npm & node. It was created using `17.3.1`

#### Installation
1. In a terminal type `npm install`
2. Wait a couple of minutes for everything to download
3. If that's all worked, that's all you need to do!
4. Type `npm run dev` and you should see a message a little like this in the terminal:

```bash
  vite v2.7.12 dev server running at:

  > Local: http://localhost:3000/
  > Network: use `--host` to expose

  ready in 203ms.
```

#### Run commands
- `npm run dev` - Starts the vite server on at `localhost:3000` (by default).
- `npm run test:watch:coverage` -  Runs (and watches) the jest tests with the coverage output

---

If you run into _any_ issues or are unsure about anything, please - let us know!

Thanks so much & we are already looking forward to meeting you!

_~ Ollie_
